#PortfolioSite

This is the first project in my pursuit of the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree from Udacity. Following is Udacity's description for this project:

"You will be provided a design mockup as a PDF-file and must replicate that design in HTML and CSS. You will develop a responsive website that will display images, descriptions and links to each of the portfolio projects you will complete through the course of the Front-End Web Developer nanodegree."

I will update this site as I complete my other projects in my Nanodegree course.
